\section{Deployment Plan}

Our deployment plan will begin once the new cable trays are installed in the laboratory, then the fiber installation from the Datacenter to the SCP will begin.
Once installed the SCP, the fiber technician will fusion the fibers kind of connections on the pre-defined points.
The following steps are to assemble the racks with the installation of the devices, including his logical configurations.


The installation of this equipment will require the help of a group of 4 people, and work will carry out throughout four days, 
taking into fiber install two days, one day to assemble de racks, and one day for logical configuration. 

\subsection{Deployment Conclusions and Considerations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Wait around 2 months for the materials to be delivered and have them at the summit.
    \item All cable installation work must be coordinated one week in advance.
\end{itemize}
