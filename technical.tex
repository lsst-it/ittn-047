\subsection{Explanation}

As the images describes, is possible to watch the proposed location of the SCP around the laboratories at the thir floor, where each cabinet will contain inside a PDU, UPS and a Gigabit Switch.
also it will be possible to move at least few meter the rack from the SCP, with fiber and power extension rolled on a reel assembly

  \subsection{Explanation}
    The above diagram represents the concept of the "always-on" connections to be implemented. 
    The idea is to have a pair of interfaces in the ACI border leafs pre-configured and always cabled up for this purpose, each pair of interfaces connect to the Service Connection Points (SCP) in such way that the switches used for integration at Level 3 can physically roam around the floor and the engineers working in the area can get the connection back online only by moving the fibers to the exact same ports in the next SCP. 
    The diagram shows only 1 switch but there will be installed one Kit ( i.e. Mobile Rack, Gigabit Switch, UPS, PDU and Reel asembly) per SCP
    For network connections you will want to use single-mode all the time to future proof the install in case of special integration requirements that ask for more bandwidth


    Some relevant points to have in consideration for the implementation:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All vPCs on the datacenter side should be configured in the same way for this to work properly and without IT intervention.
      \item The fabric will see the endpoints mac-addresses "flapping" from one port to another and Syslog may alert about this; this is expected but be careful with false-positives when it comes to monitoring and alerting.
      \item Label everything properly and provide the non-IT engineers with specific instructions for moving a switch from one SCP to another.
    \end{itemize}
